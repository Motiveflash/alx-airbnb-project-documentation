## 🧩 Feature 1: User Authentication

### ✅ Functional Requirements

- Allow users to register and log in securely.
- Support JWT-based authentication.
- Enable OAuth login (Google, Facebook).

### 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| POST   | /api/auth/register | Register new user          |
| POST   | /api/auth/login    | Authenticate existing user |
| POST   | /api/auth/oauth    | OAuth login                |
| GET    | /api/auth/profile  | Get user profile           |

### 📝 Input Specifications

**POST /api/auth/register**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword",

    "role": "guest"
  }
}
```

**On error (400/401):**
```json
{
  "error": "Email already in use"
}
```

### ⚙️ Performance Criteria
